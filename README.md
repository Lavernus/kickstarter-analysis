# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 

## Overview of Project
  The client has written a play that she estimates will need over 10,000 dollars in order to be successful. Now all that she requires is funding to bring her creation to life.
### Purpose
Utilizing Excel, this analysis will chart the success and failures of various kickstarters based on different variables. This will give the client an idea on how to launch her own kickstarter in order to increase the favorability of her project to donors. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first variable to approach was the date on which the campaign was launched. In order to visualize this I created a pivot table of the kickstarters in a separate sheet that was filtered by the years the campaigns were launched and their parent category. I then created columns based on the outcomes of the campaigns and rows based on the exact date they were created, while making sure that the years and quarters were removed from the rows as well. The value that was displayed was the count of the outcomes. This allowed me to see the amount of successes, failures, and cancellations that occurred based on the month of their launch date over all campaigns. I narrowed this down to only look at theater campaigns, as this was the area the client was interested in, and created a line graph displaying this information. ![Theater_Outcomes_Based_on_Launch_Date](https://github.com/Lavernus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second variable to approach was the goal the campaign set upon launch. I created categories of goals based on their value, with the first category being less than 1,000 dollars, the second being 1000 dollars to 4,900 dollars, and then increasing by increments of 4,900 dollars until it reached 50,000 dollars, at which point all the goals above that were grouped into one category. For each category i calculated the number of successful campaigns, failed campaigns, canceled campaigns, and total campaigns that fell within the subcategory of "plays" as that was the project the client is kickstarting. I used the countifs function to accomplish this by counting a campaign only if it fell within the range of the goal category, the subcategory of play, and the outcome I was interested in counting. For example, I calculated the total successful plays that had a goal  of less than 1000 dollars with this function:
```
=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D, "<1000", Kickstarter!F:F, "successful", Kickstarter!R:R, "plays")
```
Once I had these totals, I was able to calculate the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each category by dividing the the total campaigns of the outcome in the goal by the total campaigns in the goal. Once I had this, I was able to make a line graph visualizing the percentages of each outcome as the goal increased. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://github.com/Lavernus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most difficult thing pertaining to the outcomes based on launch date was making sure that the table was correctly counting throughout all of the data. Some of the failed campaign totals were incorrect, so I went back to the data set and made sure there were no filters being applied to it. Once that was done, I created another pivot table, making sure to use a keyboard shortcut that would select all the data instead of relying on the default that excel provides to select. This corrected the issue, which turned out to be a misselection of a smaller portion of the data than I intended. Another difficulty that could be encountered would be incorrectly filtering the data. The client doesnt need to see the outcomes based on every single day in the year; it is sufficient to show them the total of each outcome in a month.

Outcomes based on goals was trickier than based on launch date, since multiple iterations of the countif function were involved. Each goal category needed different criteria in the countif function, and each outcome needed different criteria as well. This created a situation where a function for one goal could be accidentally copied to another goal without changing any of the criteria that needed to be. Double checking each function allowed me to catch the mistakes I made. I also had some difficulty in correctly identifying all of the criteria that needed to be placed upon the count, leaving out the criteria of being a play at first. Luckily I noticed that my numbers were larger than they should be considering the scope of the client's needs, and narrowed the search to only include campaigns that include the subcategory of "plays".
## Results
The anlaysis conducted of the outcomes based on launch date showed a possible correlation between different months and their possibility of success. Successful campaigns spiked in May, which could suggest a better outcome if the client launched their campaign in that month. Successes were at their lowest in December, with both successful and failed campaigns coming the closest to being equal in that month. This could suggest a worse outcome if a campaign is launched in that month. 

Outcomes based on goals followed a trend between goals that were less than 1000 dollars and goals that were between 25,000 and 29,999 dollars that suggested a higher chance success with a lower goal and vice versa. Once past 29,999 dollars there does not seem to be a clear cut trend, but above 45,000 dollars the graph seems to suggest that there is a very low chance of any campaign working out. 

This data is primarily limited by the fact that not every Kickstarter campaign was able to be included. A good sample size was, but there is always the risk of important information being left out. This set also had much less data for goals above 25,000 dollars. Most campaigns fell below this category, so it is difficult to identify trends past this point as there is not sufficient data to accurately round out predictions for what outcomes may occur in these goals. 

Further analysis may be conducted on whether deadlines have an effect on the outcome of a campaign. Donors could experience fear of missing out if given a short deadline, but a longer deadline may allow more people to have an opportunity to give to the campaign. A line graph displaying outcomes based on the amount of time given to raise money could produce interesting insights. Whether the campaign is featured as a staff pick could also heavily influence the outcomes of the campaigns, since being featured would most likely increase the traffic the campaign sees. Creating a table displaying outcomes based on whether the campaign was a staff pick could reveal a useful trend.
